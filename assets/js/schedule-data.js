For a fixed number of colours $k$, it is known that there is a finite bound $g(k)$ for which every set of size at least $g(k)$ admits a polychromatic $k$-colouring, and a large computer search was used to help prove $g(3) = 4$. We discuss the Lean formalisation of both of these results, which mix topology, probability theory, combinatorics, and software verification, and explore how the philosophy of Lean and mathlib enable this process." },
