What followed was twelve years of building, rebuilding, and occasionally fighting with the community that formed around the project. In this talk, I give a personal account of Lean's history, from early prototypes developed with Soonho Kong, through the growth of Lean 3 and the tensions it brought, to the years Sebastian Ullrich and I spent privately building Lean 4, and finally launching the Lean FRO together. I discuss what worked, what didn't, and the friends, colleagues, and volunteers who helped keep the project alive at critical moments. I conclude with a demo of `grind`, a new tactic that brings extensible SMT-style automation to dependent type theory, finally realizing Lean's original goal of unifying interactive and automated theorem proving." },

For a fixed number of colours $k$, it is known that there is a finite bound $g(k)$ for which every set of size at least $g(k)$ admits a polychromatic $k$-colouring, and a large computer search was used to help prove $g(3) = 4$. We discuss the Lean formalisation of both of these results, which mix topology, probability theory, combinatorics, and software verification, and explore how the philosophy of Lean and mathlib enable this process." },

I will report on a collaborative formalization project in which we built a Brownian motion in Lean, which involved proving the Kolmogorov extension theorem, facts about Gaussian measures, and the Kolmogorov-Chentsov continuity theorem. After we completed this goal, the focus of the project shifted to defining stochastic integrals, which is an ongoing effort. I will talk about the lessons we learned in the project about handling stochastic processes in Lean, and discuss the latest developments towards stochastic integrals." },

This result has a notoriously difficult proof, and while the result has been generalized over the years, every found proof is full of intricate details. I will describe a recently completed formalization project that verifies all the details of a generalized Carleson theorem in Lean. I will show a few learnings for formalising harmonic analysis and in particular reflect on the collaborative nature of this formalization." },
